### Menu

but also the structure of the menu are received from a database managed by Dispenser. Its designed to stay at the top 
of the page.

#### Existing internationalization
If you already use [vue-i18n](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-i18n) to handle your internationalization and localization, we have to merge our messages into 
yours. You can do this in your `main.js` before you instantiate your Vue App.

```js
import Vue from 'vue';
...
import VueI18n from 'vue-i18n';
import { WidgetTopNavigation, WidgetBottomNavigation } from 'vca-widget-navigation' 

Vue.use(VueI18n);

const i18n = new VueI18n({
    locale: locale,
    messages: {
        'en-US': require('@/lang/en_US'),
        'de-DE': require('@/lang/de_VCA'),
        'ja-JA': require('../node_modules/element-ui/lib/locale/lang/ja')
    }
});

// the most important line of code here
Vue.use(WidgetTopNavigation, { 'i18n': i18n })
Vue.use(WidgetBottomNavigation, { 'i18n': i18n })

/* eslint-disable no-new */

new Vue({
  ...
  i18n,
  components: { WidgetTopNavigation, WidgetBottomNavigation },
  ...
}).$mount('#app');
```
Afterwards, you don't have to use `Vue.use(WidgetTopNavigation)` or `Vue.use(WidgetBottomNavigation)` in your components again.

## Development

# It'll also commit it and create a tag
npm version
# Push the bumped package and tags
git push --follow-tags
# Ship it 🚀
npm publish
